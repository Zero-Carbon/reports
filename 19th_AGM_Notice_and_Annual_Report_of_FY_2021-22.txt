CHAIRMAN’S MESSAGE
"The contribution of your Company in
building of rail infrastructure in the Country
is amply demonstrated by its remarkable
performance and presence in 26 locations
across the country with 34 functional project
implementation Unit (PIU). Your company
is executing projects in all the Zonal
Railways and 19 States of the Country."
Distinguished Shareholders,
It’s a matter of profound honour to present before you
the 19th Annual Report of your Company. The audited
accounts of the Company for the financial year
2021-22, along with the Directors’ Report.
Your Company was established with the mandate of
fast track implementation of rail infrastructure projects
working for and on behalf of Ministry of Railways as an
executing arm. "The contribution of your Company in
building of rail infrastructure in the Country is amply demonstrated by its remarkable performance and presence in
26 locations across the country with 34 functional project implementation Unit (PIU). Your company is executing
projects in all the Zonal Railways and 19 States of the Country."
During the year 2021-2022 also, the world witnessed unprecedented challenges arising out of the global outbreak of
the COVID-19 pandemic leading to a humanitarian crisis. The second wave of this pandemic which hit the country
in the very beginning of this financial year was particularly devastating. The nationwide restrictions owing to COVID
pandemic had impacted the normal operations of the Company by way of interruption of project execution. Company
was regularly assessing and monitoring the situation. The Company resumed its operations after observation of
necessary safety norms for Covid-19 and took steps to ensure safety at work place and smooth functioning of
operations. The working of the company was streamlined with work from home norms and roaster for the employees
as per the guidelines issued by the Government Authorities. Further, e-office was comprehensively implemented for
faster working. Regular meetings were held through video conferencing (VC) to continue the normal functioning of
the company. The Company took all measures to contain spread of Covid-19 among its personnel. Proactive steps
were taken to vaccinate all employees of RVNL, PMCs and the executing agencies by organizing special camps for
vaccination.
Financial Performance
In 2021-22, your company's turnover increased from Rs 15,403.65 crore to Rs 19,381.71 crore, which excludes the
element of Rs 2,325.81 crore as GST. This reflects an increase of 25.83%.
Profit Before Tax increased from Rs 1155.67 crore in 2020-21 crore to Rs 1406.10 crore in 2021-22, and Profit After
Tax (PAT) of the Company is at Rs 1087.21 crore, showing an increase of 15.59 % over the previous year.
In view of the improved financial performance, and in line with the directions of Department of Public Enterprises and
the Ministry for payment of Dividend, the Directors of your Company have recommended payment of the highest
ever final dividend of Rs 381.56 crore for 2021-22, compared to Rs 329.43 crore in the previous year. As a result, the
effective management fee of RVNL got reduced from 8.5% to 6.58%, With the payment of final dividend, the
cumulative amount paid as Dividend to the Ministry stands at Rs 1537.74 crore.
Furthermore, I am happy to mention that the Statutory Auditors have not given any qualification or remarks in the
Auditors’ Report and the Comptroller & Auditor General of India (C&AG) and Management reply thereto have been
circulated to the Shareholders.

19oh a ANNUAL REPORT
2021-22

Physical performance
Doubling / New Line / Gauge Conversion:
During the year, Company commissioned 1020.90 km of project length which included 704.80 km of Doubling and
316.10 km of Gauge Conversion thus crossing 1000 km commissioning barrier for the 1st time in its journey.
During 2021-22, 1525.45 km project length was completed including 66.75 km of New Line, 908.07 km of Doubling,
25.63 km of Gauge Conversation, 525 km of Railway Electrification. In addition, Railway Electrification of 541.35 km
was also carried out in other than specific Railway Electrification projects as part of Doubling.
During the year, five important projects Ahemdabad- Botad(170.48 km) Gauge Conversion, Dhasa-Jetalsar (104.44
km) Gauge Conversion, Raebareli- Amethi (60.1 km) doubling, Utretia- Rae Bareli (65.6 km) doubling and
Secunderabad- Mahbubnagar (85.24 km) doubling projects were fully commissioned.
Railway Electrification:
During the year, with the focus of the Ministry on the commissioning of Railway Electrification projects, Company
commissioned 776.29 Route km (1664.58 Track km) of pure Railway Electrification works on important routes.
Apart from pure RE work, 376.01 km of RE was also commissioned with the doubling projects. Thus, 1152.30 km
of electrified sections were made ready as in 2021-22. Raninagar Jalpaigudi- New Bongaigaon - Guwahati (Incl) RE
(382 km), Chikjajur- Bellary RE (184 km) and Bengaluru-Omalur Via Hosur RE (196 km) RE projects were fully
commissioned during the year.
Signalling & Telecom:
RVNL is a major contributor in providing EI installations on Indian Railways in connection with Doubling, 3rd Line,
New Line and Gauge Conversion. Keeping up its high tradition, during FY 2021-22, RVNL commissioned 111
stations out of 444 Nos of new El/Pl installations commissioned on Indian Railways, which makes almost 25% of
the total stations commissioned in a Year. RVNL as a single organization crossed the 100-station mark in a year
during FY 2021-22.
RVNL also commissioned many Major Yards such as Bina Station (423 signaling routes), Bitragunta station (336
signaling routes), Gwalior station (336 signaling routes), Rayru station (254 signaling routes), Sambalpur station
(245 signaling routes) and Bhimavaram station (145 routes) demonstrating its technical progress in Signaling
installation. For the first time on Indian Railways, a Built inBlock working in Electronic Interlocking between MBNRDTP IB on Single line between BTTR-TMC has been commissioned by RVNL on South Central Railway.
In-spite of devastating second wave of Covid at the onset of Financial year, the unrelenting effort of RVNL team has
achieved a very significant outcome in terms of the works executed during the year which is all time high in all
respect in the area of Signaling and Telecommunication. RVNL took up 152 Nos. of Non-Interlocking (NIs) of
stations for commissioning of various works during the year. RVNL commissioned not only 111 Nos of stations (109
New EIs & 02 New PIs) but also alterations in existing 35 Electronic Interlocking & 5 panel interlocking and 01
Mechanical signaling stations of Doubling & 3rd Line projects were done. Additionally, RVNL also commissioned 17
Stations of Railway Electrification Projects paving the way for all time high achievement of Railway Electrification by
RVNL on IR. RVNL also commissioned the high numbers of Interlocking of mid-section level crossing gates that
goes to 93 Nos. and 32 IBS/Auto signals. Not only on the Signaling front, RVNL also incredibly achieved 1465 km
of Fiber Optic Network and 6Quad Cable network during the year.
For the first time on Indian Railways, Railway Board entrusted RVNL to approve Logic & Interface Circuits on its
own through 3rd Party IRSTELO license holders for CR, SCR, WR & WCR up to 75 routes. This has reduced the
workload of Zonal Railway’s on document approval organization and well expedited the approval process of Logic &
Interface Circuits thus had played a pivotal role in commissioning of such a large number of stations by RVNL.
Hill Railway Projects:
Commendable progress was also made on the hill rail projects assigned to RVNL, that is, the Rishikesh- Karnaprayag
section in Uttarakhand and Bhanupali-Bilaspur-Beri section in Himachal Pradesh Budni- Barkhera- 3rd line project
in Madhya Pradesh. 31.54 km of tunneling was completed by RVNL in 2021-22. I am happy to inform that works are
progressing satisfactorily in these projects. Tunneling works in challenging Himalayan geology are being carried
out with state of art machinery and best technical expertise.

removal of hindrances by the local authorities.
With the proactive involvement of the Ministry of Railways and State Government, the projects got the required
push. The commissioning of metro lines will continue.
Pamban – Vertical Lifting Bridge:
The work on the country’s only movable bridge at Rameshwaram is progressing well with the state of Art technology
and best technical expertise. This work is expected to complete in 2022-23.
Special Purpose Vehicles:
RVNL has taken the lead for establishing six joint venture Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs) in partnership with
various stakeholders including Ports, Mines, State Governments etc. for implementation of rail connectivity project.
RVNL has contributed an equity of only Rs 1133.05 crore, against which project worth Rs 8482.51 crore are being
implemented with contribution of equity by the project partners and raising of funds through Financial Institutions.
The project under the Kutch Railway Company Ltd., Bharuch Dahej Railway Company Ltd., Krishnapatnam Railway
Company Ltd., and Haridaspur-Paradeep Railway Company Ltd. have been operationalized. These SPVs are
contributing substantially to the total revenues of the Railways.
New Railway line from Haridaspur to Paradip (82 km), a Port Connectivity Project, was commissioned on 30.07.2020,
under SPV named Haridaspur Paradip Railway Company Limited (HPRCL). During the financial year 2021-22,
HPRCL handled 6755 loaded rakes, which is an excellent performance. 23.62 MT freight loading was handled
during the year.
Doubling of 247 km of the Kutch Railway line between Palanpur and Samakhiali which is being funded completely
by the SPV at an estimated cost of Rs 2538 crore, has been taken up by RVNL on behalf of the SPV and work is
proceeding satisfactorily. Electrification of this line at an estimated cost of Rs 655 crore is also in good progress.
The physical work on Angul-Sukinda New Line project is also in good progress despite land related issues.

Human Resource Development
The primary focus of RVNL Management has been to not only attract highly motivated, skilled, and experienced
manpower but also to retain them by facilitating the right environment, competitive perks and ample opportunities
for a better career progression through training and support.
I am happy to report that HR has taken commendable initiatives in 2021- 22 for its employees as detailed below:
1.

RVNL has implemented National Pension Scheme (NPS) w.e.f. 01.01.2017 for all regular employees. This
scheme was approved in December 2021 in which 280 employees were covered including 90 retired
employees. It was a herculean task to complete the work of opening PRAN Nos and remitting the requisite
amount in the NPS/ Bank Account of the employees/ retired Employees through the agency. It is a continuous
process and new entrants to the RVNL will also be covered under the scheme.

2.

Timely promotions were made and orders were issued even before completion of requisite years of service in
the particular grade resulting in no loss of service for further promotion.

3.

RVNL has been following Government Policies diligently in regard to procurement through GeM and effective
implementation of Public Procurement Policy for MSEs.

exercised with due care and responsibility, to meet the aspirations of Shareholders and society. Your Company
complies meticulously with all legal requirements and Government guidelines regarding Corporate Governance. A
Report on Corporate Governance and Management Discussion and Analysis forms part of the Annual Report.
Acknowledgements
In the end, I would like to mention that all the achievements of RVNL, would not have been possible without the
wholehearted support provided by Indian Railways. I am also grateful for the encouragement and confidence reposed
in RVNL by the Chairman and Members of the Railway Board and other officers, that helped RVNL in contributing
substantially to the development of rail infrastructure in the Country.
I, express my sincere thanks to our esteemed Shareholders, Ministry of Finance, Department of Public Enterprises,
Ministry of Heavy Industries, the State Governments, Zonal Railways, ADB, IRFC, Financial Institutions, C&AG’s

Signalling and Telecommunication

(336 signaling routes) Rayrustation (254 signaling routes),
Sambalpur station (245 signaling routes) and
Bhimavaram station (145 routes).For the first time on
Indian Railways, a Built in Block working in Electronic
Interlocking between MBNR-DTP IB on Single line
between BTTR-TMC has been commissioned by RVNL
on South Central Railway.

Signaling & Telecommunication (S&T) domain is a core
expertise of providing signalling solutions for efficient and
safe operation of trains on Indian Railways. There has
been a significant induction of modern technologies on
Indian Railways namely Electronic Interlocking (EI),
Digital Axle Counters, Fibre Optic Cable Network
facilitating capacity building in the recent years.

RVNL is a major contributor in providing EI installations
on Indian Railways in connection with most complicated
projects of Doubling, 3rd Line, New Line and Gauge
Conversion. Keeping its tradition high, during FY 202122, RVNL has commissioned111 Nos. of stations out of
444 Nos of new El/Pl installations on Indian Railways,
which is almost 25% of the total stations commissioned
in a Year. RVNL as a single organization has crossed
the 100-station mark in a year during FY 2021-22.

In-spite of devastating second wave of Covid at the onset
of Financial year, the unrelenting effort of RVNL team
has achieved a very significant outcome in terms of the
works executed during the year which is all time high in
all respect in the area of Signaling and
Telecommunication. RVNL has taken up 152 Nos. of NonInterlocking (NIs) of stations for commissioning of various
works during the year. RVNL has commissioned not only
111 Nos of stations (109 New EIs &02 New PIs) but
alterations in existing 35 Electronic Interlocking&5 panel
interlocking and 01 Mechanical signaling stations of
Doubling& 3rd Line projects have also been done. In
addition to this, RVNL has also commissioned17 Stations
of Railway Electrification Projects paving the way for all
time high achievement of Railway Electrification by RVNL
on IR. RVNL has also commissioned the high numbers
of Interlocking of mid-section level crossing gates that
goes to 93 Nos. and 32 IBS/Auto signals. Not only on
the Signalling front, RVNL has also completed the
incredible achievement in the area of telecommunication
by providing 1465 km of Fibre Optic Network and 6Quad
Cable network during the year.

RVNL has also commissioned many Major Yards such
as Yard remodeling of Bina Station (423 signaling routes),
Bitragunta station (336 signaling routes), Gwalior station

For the first time on Indian Railways, Railway Board has,
in lieu of its own design organization, entrusted RVNL to
approve Logic & Interface Circuits on its own through 3rd

The technology driven advancement is primarily aimed
to achieve high level of safety in train operations and
increased speeds of trains with higher density of traffic.
This ensures the turnaround time of Freight Trains are
minimal as well as punctual operation of Coaching Trains
are achieved. With continuous and tireless effort of S&T
team of RVNL in the area of Railway Infrastructure, Indian
Railways is able to achieve many milestones in the sector
of freight loading and operation of large number of
passenger trains across the length and breadth of the
country.

3.11.4 The Metro corridor from Joka to Majerhat (PhaseI) has made substantial progress. In fact, from Joka
Depot to Taratala (9.0 km), there is no discontinuity and
stations are almost ready. The major impediments beyond
Taratalawere namely, Rehabilitation India building has
been dismantled, and the long pending permission from
Mint has been received from Ministry of Finance and the
viaduct work on that stretch is completed. The next hurdle
was construction of Majerhat station. Due to collapse of
old ROB at Majerhat on 4th Sept 2018, the construction
of Majerhat station came to a halt as State Government
did to give permission for the construction work. After
the commissioning of new ROB at Majerhat in Nov 2020,
NOC has since been received from State Government,
and construction of Majerhat Metro station has been
started in full swing, and is expected to be completed in
another one year. For construction of MJT station (MJT
Yard) launching of steel girders are being erected after
obtaining sanction of CRS/N.F. Circle. The station over
yard is on three layers.

Kolkata Metro Projects:

3.11.1 Indian Railway transferred the works of four
major projects for extension of Kolkata Metro to RVNL
in March 2010 viz.
•

Joka-BBD Bag via Majerhat (16.72 km)

•

Dum Dum Airport-New Garia via Rajarhat (32 km)

•

Baranagar-Barrackpore& Dakshineswar (14.5 km)

•

Noapara (Ex.)-Baranagar (2.6 km)

Beyond Majerhat, the Joka to Majerhat Metro Corridor is
being extended upto Esplanade going underground from
Mominpurramp. The GC-cum-PMC contract for the
underground section has been awarded recently and the
underground construction tender for tunnelling by TBM
will be called shortly so that the underground work can
start in full swing. Working permission has accorded after
Hon’ble High Court clearance, Kolkata for execution in
defence land in the Maidan area for the public interest of
Kolkata. The Victoria Memorial Trust issued. NOC has
been received recently to go ahead with underground
station near Victoria Memorial.

3.11.2 Thereon RVNL was entrusted to build Metro
corridors of about 65 km in Kolkata without any survey
of underground utilities and without any DPR (Detailed
Project Report). DPR is a pre-requisite for planning of
Metro corridors in urban areas. RVNL first engaged
RITES for preparation of DPR. Late arrival of metro
extension work in the congested and unplanned city was
a challenge and required a lot of meticulous planning for
identification and removal of encroachments and other
impediments to start construction activity of Metro. The
land acquisition in Kolkata/West Bengal poses a big
problem causing delayed construction of Metro corridors
and other infrastructural projects. The issues like removal
of encroachments and relocation of utilities along with
traffic diversion have affected the execution. RVNL has
taken all possible action for implementation and early
commissioning of Metro projects for larger interest of
people of Kolkata.

Since this Metro stretch is a standalone system, a
Maintenance Depot is a pre-requisite. However, due to
non-availability of land (24.48 hectare), the tender for
the depot was discharged twice, once in February 2013
and again on October 2017. At present, land to the extent
of 94%, in Kolkata city has been acquired and land
development with boundary wall is almost completed.
Contract for construction of maintenance depot has also
been awarded and is in progress. In this section the
commissioning will be in 3 phase i.e (a)Ph-I-JokaTaratala, (b)Ph-II-Taratala-Majerhat, (c) Ph-III- MajerhatEsplanade. The Commissioning of 1st phase is expected
to be done by October 2022 i.e. during this year. By
commissioning the 1st phase the outskirt population of
Kolkata will be connected to Kolkata which will be a
great relief for the people residing away from Kolkata
but normally come to Kolkata on day basis doing a
tough journey every day.

3.11.3 The foundation stone for Joka-BBD Bag project
was laid by Her Excellency, President of India on
22.01.2010. Subsequently, 2 packages for viaduct and 2
packages for stations were awarded in December 2010
and April 2012 respectively. This entire Metro corridor
has been planned in 2 phases i.e. in 1st phase from Joka
to Majerhat elevated section and in the 2nd phase from
Mominpur to BBD Bag as underground section. Originally
sanctioned as elevated section but Material Modification
is sanctioned by Ministry of Railways for underground
system. For construction of Mominpur station,

New Garia-Airport Metro Corridor
3.11.5.In the section of New Garia to Rabindra Tirtha of
Dum Dum Airport-New Garia project, initially 4 packages
of Viaduct were awarded on 21.10.2011. About 17 km
viaduct has been completed. The contracts for 21
stations (3 packages) were awarded on 05.03.2014. Out
of 21 stations, station land for one (Technopolis Metro
station) is just handed over. For construction of stations,
6481 piles, 813 pile caps, 789 piers & 677 pier caps
have been cast. The project got delayed because of
issues relating to land acquisition, traffic diversion, utility
diversion and other permission over busy EM Bypass
road. Further, change of alignment proposed by State
Government where unauthorized buildings were
constructed even after the Gazette Notification for Metro
construction, and other impediments like shifting of
markets, traffic guard, raising of 220 KV overhead line,
removal of encroachments, etc. slowed down the
progress of work. Substantial part of these impediments
have been either removed and the balance are on the

For the second phase of this Metro corridor, i.e.
Baranagar- Barrackpore, an MoU was signed between
State Government, Metro Railway and RVNL in October
2011 where it was decided that RVNL shall commence
the work of Metro viaduct construction on BT Road after
commissioning of 64" pipeline under the BT Road with
the closure of 60" and 42" diameter pipelines. The work
of new pipeline has been commissioned but RVNL has
not been able to start the work due to non-compliance of
provisions of tripartite MoU by the State Government.
State Government in their letter of 03.05.2018 had
proposed for change of alignment i.e. through Kalyani

way of being removed. The alignment from City CentreII to Airport is now approved by State Government after
long persuasion and contract for construction of Metro
beyond Titumir to Airport has been awarded on
18.01.2021, The work is under progress.In this section
the commissioning will be in 3 phase i.e (a)Ph-I-New
Garia- Hemanta Mukherjee, (b)Ph-II-Hemanta Mukherjee
to Salt Lake sector V and, (c) Ph-III-Salt Lake Sector VAirport. The Commissioning of 1st phase is expected to
be done by September 2022 i.e., during this year.
Noapara - Baranagar – Dakshineswar Metro
3.11.6 For Baranagar- Barrackpore & Dakshineswar and

i.e. the first phase being Noapara- BaranagarDakshineswar and in the second phase, from BaranagarBarrackpore. The first phase, i.e. from Noapara to
Dakshineswar, the Metro corridor has been inaugurated
and dedicated to the Nation by Hon’ble Prime Minister
on 22.02.2021for public use.

Expressway. Ministry of Railways (CRB) had responded
this proposal by writing to Chief Secretary, GoWB that
under such a situation, it will become a new project
requiring fresh sanction. RVNL, on its part, had requested
State Government vide letter dated 19.11.2018 to lay a
new pipeline through another alignment for which RVNL
would bear the cost. Vide a recent letter dated 05.05.2022
State Govt. asked for a additional pipe line of 90" dia. at
project cost in lieu of closing 60", 48", 42" pipe lines on
BT Road. Work onthis phase of the Metro corridor could
not be initiated due to above account.

Joka-Taratala:9.0 km of continuous stretch from
Joka Depot has been completed. Major structures
and stations have been completed at Joka,
Thakurpukur, Shaker Bazar, Behala Chowrasta,
Behala Bazaar, Taratala. It is now programmed
to commission the first phase i.e. Joka to Taratala
of Joka-Esplanade Section by October 2022.

As the size of projects being executed by RVNL is quite
large, to ensure fast award and execution of projects,
RVNL invites tenders consisting of multiple packages.
Each tender may consist of up to 3 contract packages.
This approach has a number of advantages such as:

New Garia-Hemanta Mukherjee in Airport
corridor: 5.76 km viaduct including stations
portions are now in final stage except for a small
gap before Kavi Sukanta stations where the work
is going in full swing and will be bridged up by
June 2022 completely. It is now programmed to
commission the first phase i.e. New GariaHemanta Mukherjee of New Garia-Airport section
by September 2022.

Multiple contracts can be awarded through one
tender which saves time and effort in invitation
and finalization of tenders.

b)

Both small and large agencies can compete for
any contract package which increases
competition.

c)

Large agencies who are capable of executing big
contracts can quote for multiple packages to
achieve economy of scale and pass on the benefit
to RVNL by quoting discounts in case of award of
more than one package.

d)

Smaller agencies, which would not be eligible to
quote if the tender for the project was floated in a
single package, are now able to compete in any
of the contract packages individually as they may
meet the qualification requirements of individual
packages which are of comparatively smaller value.

ADB funded projects:

The first ADB loan (IND-1981) sanctioned for “Railway
Sector Improvement” was closed on 31.12.2011. A 2nd
ADB Loan has been sanctioned for funding of 5 projects,

MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS REPORT
transporting passengers as well as cargo. To remain
competitive vis-à-vis other transportation modes and to
provide optimum level of service to passengers and for
freight, there is an acute need to invest in railway
infrastructure to augment capacity, expand the network
and make it more efficient and customer centric.

Industry Structure and Development:
India has the fourth largest railway network in the world
with a total length of 68, 442 route kilometer (rkm). It
runs nearly 22, 000 trains daily, out of which around 13,
500 are passenger trains that carry more than 2.3 crore
passengers and about 8, 500 are freight trains that carry
around 3.5 million tonnes of freight per day. The
humungous magnitude of operations on Indian Railway
can be appreciated from the fact that every day it moves
people nearlyequal to the population of Australia.

Role of Rail Vikas Nigam Limited:
RVNL was incorporated with an objective to undertake
rail project development, mobilization of financial
resources and implementation of rail projects pertaining
to strengthening of golden quadrilateral and port
connectivity and raising of extra- budgetary resources
for project execution. RVNL is in the business of
executing all types of railway projects including new lines,
doubling, gauge conversion, railway electrification, metro
projects, workshops, major bridges, construction of cable
stayed bridges, institutional buildings etc.

In the recent past, various railway reforms have been
initiated at the organisational and functional level to
enhance efficiency, safety, innovations and transparency
and to achieve faster project execution. Participative
models for rail connectivity, introduction of private train
operators and the focus on encouraging participation of
the private sector in infrastructure up gradation and station
development are note worthy reforms.

RVNL functions as an executing arm of Indian Railways
and works for and on behalf of the Ministry for projects
assigned to it for execution. It generally works on a
turnkey basis and undertakes the full cycle of project
development from conceptualization to commissioning
including stages of design, preparation of estimates,
calling and award of contracts, project and contract
management, etc.

Indian Railways has prepared a National Rail Plan (NRP)
for India - 2030 which envisages to create a “Future
Ready” Railway system. The NRP is aimed to formulate
strategies based on both operational capacities and
commercial policy initiatives to increase modal share of
the Railways in freight to 45%. The objective of the Plan
is to create capacity ahead of demand by 2030. As part
of this Plan, Vision 2024 has been launched for
accelerated implementation of certain critical projects
by 2024 such as 100% electrification, multi-tracking of
congested routes, upgradation of speed to 160 kmph on
certain routes, upgradation of speed to 130 kmph on all
other Golden quadrilateral – Golden Diagonal routes and
elimination of all Level Crossings on such routes. While
new sections are being progressively commissioned for
traffic in the Eastern and Western Dedicated Freight
Corridors, new Dedicated Freight Corridors have been
identified and expansion of rail networks in Jammu and
Kashmir and North Easter region of the country is being
emphasized.

The projects are spread all over the country and for
efficient implementation of projects, 38 Project
Implementation Units (PIUs) have been established at
26 locations to execute projects in their geographical
hinterland. They are located at Ahmedabad, Agra,
Ambala, Bengaluru, Bhopal, Bhubaneshwar (2 Units),
Chennai (2 Units), Chandigarh (2 Units), Guwahati,
Jodhpur, Jhansi, Kanpur, Kolkata (3 Units), Kharagpur,
Kota (2 Units), Lucknow (3 Units), Mumbai, Pune (2
Units), Patna, Raipur, Rishikesh, Ranchi, Secunderabad,
Varanasi (3 Units), Vijayawada and Waltair (2 Units).
The PIUs are established and closed as per requirement.
RVNL’s major client is the Indian Railways and other
clients include various central and state government
ministries, departments, and public sector undertakings.
RVNL has also started participating in Metro, Highways
and other infrastructure sectors through competitive
bidding.

Many new improvements, such as self-designed Vande
bharat Express, Tejas Express, Vistadome Coaches,
new Signalling Systems, Long Haul Freight Trains, High
Capacity and High Speed wagons, Kisan Rail, Solar
powered passenger coaches etc have been undertaken
to bring about sea change in customer comforts and
expectations. Innovative improvements are also being
brought upon by assimilating new technologies in the
form of SMART Coaches, SMART Locomotives, SMART
Yards, Automated Train Examination System, Automatic
Train Protection, Centralized Traffic Control and Train
Management System etc.

As part of its original mandate, RVNL has successfully
set up five project specific Special Purpose Vehicles
(SPVs) for execution of important rail connectivity projects
in PPP mode. Four SPVs have already been
commissioned for traffic. More SPVs are in different
stages of being set up under Indian Railways’ participative
policy framework.

Indian Railways is considered the country’s lifeline for

RVNL has also recognised the vast potential for building
a High Speed Rail Network in the country and with the
approval of President of India had formed High Speed
Rail Corporation of India Ltd. (HSRC), as its subsidiary.
Feasibility studies for Delhi-Kolkata, Delhi-Mumbai,
Mumbai-Chennai, Mumbai-Kolkata (upto Nagpur in 1st
Phase), Delhi-Chennai and Delhi-Chandigarh-Amritsar
have been undertaken by HSRC. Subsequently, HSRC
has been renamed as HSRC Infra and repurposed to
participate in bidding of projects for RVNL and to provide
project management consultancy services.

for funding of projects whichis critical for the future
growth of the Company and for timely
implementation of projects.
•

RVNL has not been notified as a Zonal Railway
and accordingly does not have the authority to
approve drawings, designs etc.

•

As per the MoU executed in October 2003, RVNL
was mandated for obtaining sanction from
Commissioner of Railway Safety but subsequently
the same was withdrawn in November 2007.
Authority for CRS sanction shall expedite the
project commissioning and enhance the project
delivery.

•

The progress of projects often gets impaired on
account of delays in securing the necessary
approvals for plans, granting of traffic blocks, etc.
from Zonal Railways.

•

Changes in approved plans by the Railways,
during execution of projects, result in delays.

•

RVNL has to depend on Railways for traffic blocks
for execution of projects which causes delays.

•

RVNL does not have the freedom to plan execution
of projects and has to follow priorities set by
Railways.

•

RVNL is dependent on Ministry of Railways for
approval of projects to be taken up through SPV
route and for the terms of the Concession
Agreement.

Strengths
•

in all aspects of construction covering full Project
Life Cycle to achieve high quality output.
It has refined its tendering processes and
introduced innovative concepts like multi-package
tenders resulting in faster decision making and
savings in overall costs

•

It has a sound and robust financial management
system, allowing for effective monitoring and
control of expenditure.

•

RVNL has also mobilized funds for the construction
of new lines by creating project specific SPVs
with strategic stakeholders. Its large capital base
can be leveraged to raise funds as per its original
mandate.

•

As RVNL can award large value contracts, it has
been able to attract the best infrastructure
companies in India.

•

Ministry of Railways has delegated the authority
to RVNL for sanctioning of estimates within
prescribed limits and for awarding contracts of
any value for the projects in handenabling RVNL
to implement projects faster.

•

It has developed expertise in undertaking all
stages of project development - from concept to
commissioning.

•

RVNL has developed the requisite skills and
experience to follow ADB procedures for
contracting and ensure Resettlement and
Rehabilitation of Project Affected Persons to
implement socio-economic safeguards.

•

HSRC Infra Services Limited, a subsidiary of
RVNL, is available to provide consultancy service
and also for implementation of high speed
corridors in the time to come.

•

RVNL has set up a Business Development Cell
to participate in competitive bidding process in
Infrastructure Sector.

Opportunities

Weaknesses
•

RVNL is dependent on the Ministry of Railways
59

•

With the work of execution of Kolkata Metro
projects, RVNL has developed expertise for
implementation of metro projects in other cities
across the Country.

•

RVNL has successfully constructed major
workshops for Indian Railways in fast track mode.
RVNL can thus undertake implementation of large
buildings, factories, townships etc. for other
agencies as well.

•

With RVNL’s growth as a major provider of a variety
of rail infrastructure, there is an opportunity of

RVNL has formed a subsidiary company for the
development and implementation of High Speed
Rail projects - High Speed Rail Corporation of India
Ltd. which can provide opportunities for:
—

Implementation of High Speed Corridors in
the Country

—

Upgradation of some routes for semi high
speed operation as planned by MoR, e.g.
Chennai -Bengaluru -Mysore (130 km) etc.

PSUs. Wherever required, RVNL has also recruited
specialists to provide expert guidance in its project
implementation.
A comprehensive and appropriate training programme is
being implemented to develop competent, suitably skilled
and qualified manpower. Efforts are also being made to
transfer skills and best practices from other infrastructure
sectors and acquiring skills related to execution of railway
projects.
The Mission, Vision and Objectives of the Company
as per the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU)
are mentioned below:

Threats
•

•

The shortage of technical manpower, with required
experience in the rail sector, is a major constraint
in the delivery of projects.

Mission
To create state of the art rail transport infrastructure to
meet the growing demand.

A large percentage of RVNL workforce is
deputationists from Indian Railways. Any adverse
policy decision may result in railway officers not
being available for deputation.

•

Land acquisition issues require to be resolved
expeditiously so that the progress of projects is
not hampered.

•

Delays in clearances for project execution such
as tree-cutting, removal of utilities from the
construction of viaducts for metro rail projects etc.

•

A number of projects are being executed along
existing running lines, which makes safety a
serious challenge.

•

Projects are adversely affecteddue to poor law
and order conditions such as those in Left Wing
Extremists affected districts.

•

Stoppage of work by MOR on nomination basis
and withdrawal of power to sanction of estimate.

Vision
To emerge as the most efficient provider of rail
infrastructure, with a sound financial base and global
construction practices, for timely completion of projects.
Objectives

Industrial Relation: Industrial Relations remained
harmonious and cordial.

•

To undertake and execute successfully project
development, financing and implementation of
projects relating to infrastructure, especially rail
infrastructure

•

To mobilize financial and human resources for
project implementation;

•

Timely execution of projects with least cost
escalation;

•

To maintain a cost effective organizational set up;

•

To encourage public private participation in rail
related projects managed by RVNL;

•

To be an infrastructure Project Execution
Company committed to sustainable development
and environment friendly construction practices
of rail related projects in the country;

•

To acquire, purchase, license, concession or
assign rail infrastructure assets including
contractual rights and obligation with the approval
of MoR whenever required.

Strategies
The Company is taking measures for ensuring cost control
and timely delivery of projects, without any compromise
on quality for the execution and delivery of rail
infrastructure projects on a fast track basis. RVNL can
play a significant role in Ministry of Railways’ efforts of
raising extra-budgetary resources for project
implementation, especially through the SPV route.
Innovative models for project financing will also have to
be explored. RVNL has also requested Ministry of
Railways’ that it may be permitted to leverage its equity
base to raise funds from the market as per its mandate.

Outlook
The Company proposes to expand its operations through
its Subsidiary Company which will undertake the siding
construction, siding maintenance, procurement of
machines for operation and maintenance, PMC/GC
services, solar panel work, Transmission line work,
Export of wagon/coaches, Cranes etc, construction of
Metro and HSR and also include biding in the open
market and thus it would be bidding arm of the parent
Company i.e. RVNL.

RVNL has created a permanent cadre through absorption
to provide institutional continuity and to reduce the
dependence on seeking officers and staff on deputation
from Railways. Most of the workforce consists of qualified
technical staff with experience in Railways and/or its

Over a period of time, it is noticed that there is a huge
outstanding share of project expenditure due from State
Government/Union Government e.g. Government of
Andhra Pradesh, Telengana, Himachal Pradesh,
Maharashtra for about Rs. 2776.91 crore and MoRTH
about Rs. 237.43 crore. Such committed funds from
State and Union Government have got bearings on project
delivery.

Delays in land acquisition, finalization of plans by users,
timely clearance of permissions from other government
departments (mainly Ministry of Environment and
Forests), law and order problems, and the continued
support from Ministry of Railways are main concern areas
in project execution. The capacity constraints of
agencies capable of delivery of large value rail
infrastructure projects will also have to be addressed to
ensure the successful and timely completion of projects.

b)

Fair value through Other Comprehensive
Income.

d.

c)

Fair value through Profit and loss account.

Financial Assets are measured at fair value through other
comprehensive income if these financial assets are held
within a business whose objective is achieved by both
collecting contractual cash flows and setting financial
assets and the contractual terms of the financial asset
give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely
payment of principal and invest in the principal amount
outstanding.

Debt instrument at Amortised Cost

A financial asset shall be measured at amortised cost if
both of the following conditions are met:
(a)

the financial asset is held within a business model
whose objective is to hold financial assets in order
to collect contractual cash flows and

(b)

The contractual terms of the financial asset give
rise on specified dates to cash flows that are
solely payments of principal and interest on the
principal amount outstanding.

Financial assets measured at amortised cost using
effective interest rate method less impairment if any. The
EIR amortisation is included in finance income in the
statement of profit and loss.
b.

Debt instrument at FVTOCI

A debt instrument is classified as at the FVTOCI if both
of the following criteria are met:
•

The objective of the business model is achieved
both by collecting contractual cash flows and
selling the financial assets and

•

The asset’s contractual cash flows represent
SPPI.

Debt instruments included within the FVTOCI category
are measured initially as well as at each reporting date
at fair value. Fair value movements are recognized in the
Other Comprehensive Income (OCI). However the
company recognizes interest income impairment losses
& reversals and foreign exchange gain or loss in the P&L.
On de-recognition of the asset cumulative gain or loss
previously recognised in OCI is reclassified from the equity
to P&L. Interest earned is recognised using the EIR
method.
c.

Debt instrument at FVTPL

FVTPL is a residual category for financial Assets. Any
financial assets which does not meet the criteria for
categorization as at amortized cost or as FVTOCI is
classified as at FVTPL.
In addition the company may elect to designate financial
asset which otherwise meets amortized cost or FVTOCI
criteria as at FVTPL. If doing so reduces or eliminates a
measurement or recognition inconsistency. The company
has not designated any financial asset as at FVTPL.
Financial assets included within the FVTPL category are
measured at fair value with all changes recognized in
the P&L.Investment in Equity instruments are measured
through FVTOCI

Equity Instrument at Other Comprehensive
Income

The company has made an irrevocable election to present
in other comprehensive income subsequent changes in
the fair value of equity investments not held for trading.
(ii)

Financial liabilities

a)

Financial liabilities at Amortised Cost

cash flows from the asset expires or it transfers the
financial assets and substantially all risks s and rewards
of the ownership of the asset.
Financial Liability A financial liability is derecognised
when the obligation under the liability is discharged or
cancelled or expires. When an existing financial liability
is replaced by another from the same lender on
substantially different terms or the terms of an existing
liability are substantially modified such an exchange or
modification is treated as a derecognition of the original
liability and the recognition of a new liability and the
difference in the respective carrying amounts is
recognised in the income statement.
(D)

Impairment of financial assets:

Company applies expected credit loss (ECL) model for
measurement and recognition of impairment loss. The
Company follows’ simplified approach’ for recognition of
impairment loss allowance on trade receivable. The
application of simplified approach does not require the
Company to track changes in credit risk. Rather it
recognises impairment loss allowance based on lifetime
ECLs at each reporting date right from its initial

recognitionCompany assesses on a forward looking basis
the expected credit losses associated with its assets
carried at amortised cost and FVTOCI debt instruments.
The impairment methodology applies on whether there
has been significant increase in credit risk.
2.23 Non-current Assets (or disposal groups) held
for Sale
Non-current assets (or disposal groups) are classified
as assets held for sale when their carrying amount is to
be recovered principally through a sale transaction and
a sale is considered highly probable. The sale is
considered highly probable only when the asset or
disposal group is available for immediate sale in its
present condition it is unlikely that the sale will be
withdrawn and sale is expected within one year from the
date of the classification. Disposal groups classified as
held for sale are stated at the lower of carrying amount
and fair value less costs to sell. Property plant and
equipment and intangible assets are not depreciated or
amortised once classified as held for sale. Assets
classified as held for sale are presented separately in
the statement of financial position.
If the criteria stated by IND AS 105 “Non-current Assets
Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations” are no longer

met the disposal group ceases to be classified as held
for sale. Non-current asset that ceases to be classified
as held for sale are measured at the lower of (i) its
carrying amount before the asset was classified as held
for sale adjusted for depreciation that would have been
recognised had that asset not been classified as held
for sale and (ii) its recoverable amount at the date when
the disposal group ceases to be classified as held for
sale.

by restating the comparative amounts for the prior periods
presented in which the error occurred. If the error occurred
before the earliest period presented, the opening balances
of assets, liabilities and equity for the earliest period
presented, are restated.

Sensitivity analysis:
The above sensitivity analysis is based on a change in an assumption while holding all other assumptions constant.
In practice, this is unlikely to occur, and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated. When calculating
the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to significant actuarial assumptions the same method (projected unit
credit method) has been applied as when calculating the defined benefit obligation recognised within the statement
of financial position.

(iii) Financial risk management
The Company’s principal financial liabilities comprise Borrowings from IRFC, trade payable and other payables. The
Company’s principal financial assets include trade and lease receivables and cash & cash equivalents that are
derived directly from its operations.The Company is exposed to market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. The
company’s financial risk activities are governed by appropriate policies and procedures and that financial risk are
identified, measured and managed in accordance with the company’s policies and risk objectives. The board of
directors reviews the policies for managing each of these risk, which are summarised below:a) Market Risk
Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instruments will fluctuate because of
changes in market prices. Market risk comprises Interest rate risk and foreign currency risk. Financial instruments
affected by market risk includes loans and borrowing, deposits and other non derivative financial instruments.
i) Interest Rate Risk
Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instruments will fluctuate because of
change in market interest rate. The company has only loan from IRFC, the payment of interest and repayment of
principal of that is ensured by the Ministry of Railways; therefore the risk related to said loan is Nil, debt servicing
will pass through RVNL books only.
ii) Foreign Currency Risk
The company takes services from countries outside India for projects and is exposed to foreign currency risk
arising from such foreign currency transactions. Due to immateriality of foreign exchange amount company does
not hedge any risk.
b) Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Company if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to
meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Company’s receivables from customers. The company
is exposed to credit risk from its financial activities in respect of financial instruments and the risk is negligible since
the receivable are mainly from ministry of railways and state governments. also company does not have any history
of bad debts.
Financial instruments and cash deposits
Credit risk from balances with banks and financial institutions is managed in accordance with the company‘s
policy. Investment of surplus are made only with approved with counterparty on the basis of the financial quotes
received from the counterparty.
c) Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the company will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they become due. The
company manages its liquidity risk by ensuring, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to
meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or
risk to the company’s reputation.The company’s principal sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents and
the cash flow that is generated from operations. The company believes that the working capital is sufficient to meet
its current operational requirements. Any short term- surplus cash generated, over and above the amount required
for working capital management and other operational requirements, are retained as cash and investment in short

159

2021-22

term deposits with banks. The said investments are made in instruments with appropriate maturities and sufficient
liquidity.
Note 32 Key sources of estimation uncertainty
The followings are the key assumptions concerning the future, and the key sources of estimation uncertainty at the
end of the reporting period that may have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amount
of assets and liabilities with next financial year.
a) Fair valuation measurement and valuation process
Financial instruments are measured initially at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost on the basis of
materiality, transaction value upto Rs.12.00 lakhs are measured at fair value on initial recognition and subsequently
at amortised cost on group basis by considering that the amount is recoverable or payable at a average period of
5 years and Income and amortisation on such financial instruments has been considered on yearly basis. Transaction
value of Rs. 12.00 lakhs or more are measured at fair value at initial recognition and subsequently at amortised cost
on individual transaction basis. Impact of fair valuation of Staff loans and advances are immaterial therefore it has
been continuing at the carrying value.
The fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities is measured the valuation techniques including the DCF
model. The inputs to these method are taken from observable markets where possible, but where this is not
feasible, a degree of judgment is required in establishing fair values. Judgments include considerations of inputs
such as liquidity risk, credit risk and volatility. Changes in assumptions about these factors could affect the reported
fair value of financial instruments. See Note 31 for further disclosures.
b) Taxes
Deferred tax assets are recognized for unused tax losses and unabsorbed depreciation to the extent that it is
probable that taxable profit will be available against which losses can be utilised. Significant management judgment
is required to determine the amount of deferred tax asset that can be recognised, based upon the likely timing and
level of future taxable profit together with future tax planning strategies.
c ) Borrowings and Lease Receivables from Railway against Completed Projects
Company has borrowed funds from Indian Railway Finance Corporation for the purpose of construction of railway
projects. There is a moratorium period of 3 years for each year’s loan. During the said moratorium period, no
amount on account of interest and principal shall be payable. The interest shall be charged on yearly basis and
repayment of loan along with interest shall be once in a year (for a period of 12 years) after the completion of
moratorium period. Ministry of Railways would make available to RVNL the required funds thereafter, to enable them
to do the debt servicing. The debt servicing will pass through RVNL books. Accordingly, funds are received by RVNL
on each year from MoR and the same is transferred to IRFC. Therefore, there is no impact on Statement of Profit &
Loss of the Company.

potentially result in significant liabilities.Management’s
disclosures with regards to provisions and contingent
liabilities relating to provisions and contingent liabilities
relating to ongoing litigations are presented in note
no. 37 to the Company’s standalone financial
statements.The assessment of whether a liability is
recognised as a provision or disclosed as a contingent
liability in the standalone financial statements is
inherently subjective and requires significant
management judgement in determination of the cash
outflows from the business, interpretation of applicable
laws and regulations, and careful examination of
pending assessments at various levels of regulatory
authorities.

identification and measurement of provisions and
contingent liabilities relating to ongoing litigation

considered to be a key audit matter for the current
year audit.

assessment of the likelihood, magnitude and
accounting of any liability that may arise in
certain material cases. Accordingly, we reviewed
the amount of provisions recognized and
contingent liabilities disclosed in the standalone
financial statements and exercised our
professional judgement to assess
appropriateness of such conclusions, involving
experts as required.

Evaluated the adequacy of disclosures made in
the Company’s standalone financial statements
in accordance with the applicable accountin
standards.

Responsibilities of the management and those charged with governance for the standalone financial
statements
The accompanying standalone financial statements have been approved by the Company’s Board of Directors. The
Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the matters stated in Section 134(5) of the Act with respect to the
preparation of these standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view of the financial position, financial
performance, other comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows of the Company in accordance with
the accounting principles generally accepted in India, including the Accounting Standards specified under Section
133 of the Act, read with the Companies(lndian Accounting Standards)Rules,2015. This responsibility also includes
maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding of the
assets of the Company and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of
appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and design,
implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring
the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the
financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or
error.
In preparing the standalone financial statements, the Board of Directors is responsible for assessing the Company’s
ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the
going concern basis of accounting unless the Board of Directors either intends to liquidate the Company or to
cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
The Board of Directors is also responsible for overseeing the Company’s financial reporting process.
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the standalone financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the standalone financial statements as a whole
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our
opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in
accordance with SAS will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from
fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to
influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these standalone financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with the Standards on Auditing, specified under section 143(10) of the Act, we
exercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:
z

Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or
error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement
resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional
omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.

z

Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are
appropriate in the circumstances. Under Section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for expressing
our opinion on whether the Company has adequate internal financial controls system in place and the
opeçating effectiveness of such controls.

z

Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates
and related disclosures made by the management.

z

Conclude on the appropriateness of management’ s use of the going concern basis of accounting and,
based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions
that may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that
a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures
in the standalone financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our
conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future
events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.

z

Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures,
and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that
achieves fair presentation.

182

zWe communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and

timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we
identify during our audit.

We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical
requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may
reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of
most significance in the audit of the standalone financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key
audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure
about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated
in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public
interest benefits of such communication.
Other matters
The audit of standalone financial statements of the Company for the corresponding year ended 3 1 st March, 2021
included in the standalone financial statements was carried out and reported upon by predecessor audit firm who
had expressed an unmodified conclusion vide their audit report dated 29th June, 2021, whose audit report has been

Annexure C To the Independent Auditor’s Report
Referred to in paragraph 3(f) under ‘Report on other legal and regulatory requirements’ section of our
report of even date for the year ended 31 st March, 2022 to the members of Rail Vikas Nigam Limited.
Report on the Internal Financial Controls referred under Clause (i) of Sub-section 3 of Section 143 of the
Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”)
We have audited the internal financial controls over financial reporting of Rail Vikas Nigam Limited (“the Company”)
as of 31 st March 2022 in conjunction with our audit of the standalone financial statements of the Company for the
year ended on that date.
Management’s responsibility for internal financial controls
The Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial controls based on
the internal control over financial reporting criteria established by the Company considering the essential components
of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting
issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (‘ICAI’), These responsibilities include the design,
implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring
the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to company’s policies, the safeguarding of its
assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting
records, and thc timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required under the Companies Act, 2013.
Auditors’ responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal financial controls over financial reporting
based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial
Controls over Financial Reporting (the “Guidance Note”) and the Standards on Auditing, issued by ICAI and deemed
to be prescribed under section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal
financial controls, both applicable to an audit of Internal Financial Controls and, both issued by the Institute of
Chartered Accountants of India. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical
requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate internal
financial controls over financial reporting was established and maintained and if such controls operated effectively in
all material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial
controls system over financial reporting and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls over
financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls over financial reporting, assessing
the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of
internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including
the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit
opinion on the Company’s internal financial controls system over financial reporting.
Meaning of internal financial controls over financial reporting
A company’s internal financial control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal financial control over financial
reporting includes those policies and procedures that
(1)

pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions
and dispositions of the assets of the company;

(2)

provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures
of the company are being made only in accordance with authorisations of management and directors of the
company; and

(3)

provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or
disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

190

Inherent limitations of internal financial controls over financial reporting
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls over financial reporting, including the possibility of
collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and
not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls over financial reporting to future
periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial control over financial reporting may become inadequate
because of changes in cond;tions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Opinion
In our opinion, the Company has, in all material respects, an adequate internal financial controls system over
financial reporting (except for the matter specified in the “Basis for qualified opinion” section of our report) and such
internal financial controls over financial reporting were operating effectively as at 31 March 2022, based on the
internal control over financial reporting criteria established by the Company considering the essential components
of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting
issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India.

1.

The Company receives advance payment
from Joint Venture Companies for
incurringexpenditures on their projects.
However, in case of one related party i.e.
Krishnapatnam Railway Company Limited
(KRCL), the Company is incurring project
expenditures on aregular basis but
insignificant amount has been received
from KRCL during the year and thetotal
amount receivable from KRCL as on 31st
March, 2022 is Rs.1368.28 crore
whichincludes Rs.530.18 crore on account
of interest (refer note nos. 10.1 & 10.6 to
the standalonefinancial statements).

M/s Krishnapatnam Railways Company Limited (KPRCL) is
a Special Purpose Vehicle created especially for providing
rail connectivity to Krishnapatnam Port in Andhra Pradesh.
As on 31st March 2022 Rail Vikas Nigam Limited holds
49.76% equity shares in KPRCL. The work was executed in
two phases. The execution of the construction work was
undertaken by RVNL. As per the construction agreement,
KPRCL was to pay quarterly advances to RVNL for execution
of the work. but due to dispute between MoR and KPRCL
regarding apportionment of revenue from traffic, KPRCL
havenot able to generate enough revenue to finance the
construction work through RVNL. But as the contracts had
already been awarded by RVNL, commitments had to be
met out of its own source. Also, as per the terms and
conditions of the concession agreement stopping of works
would have resulted into bigger loss to RVNL.Since the
second phase of the project has also been opened for traffic
which is now picking up after the decline due to the impact
of COVID -19, it is expected that sufficient revenue will be
generated and KPRCL will be paying back the balance due
to RVNL along with interest as per the construction
agreement. During the current financial year i.e. 2021-22
already by 31.07.22 Rs. 14 crores have been received from
KPRCL.Authorities of KPRCL are being pursued for arranging
payments to RVNL.

2.

Balances of some of the Trade
Receivables, Other Assets, Trade and
Other Payable accounts are subject to
confirmation/reconciliation from the
respective parties . The management does
not expect to have any material differences
affecting the financial statements for the
year ended 31stMarch, 2022 (refer note no.
49 to the standalone financial statements).

These are mainly advances to Zonal Railways given either for
execution of works on behalf of RVNL or supply of sleepers
and rails for utilisation in RVNL projects, which is a regular
process. Zonal Railways are advised to give accountal of the
advance given but confirmations of outstanding balances from
some Zonal Railways were not received in spite of repeated
requests. The advance was given to Electricity Companies
for either power supplies or for shifting of cables in connection
with the projects against which the accountalis received on
completion of the work.Payables mainly include funds
received from MoR pending adjustment and security deposits/
retention monies.Management does not expect to have any
material financial impact of such pending confirmations/
reconciliations.

accounted under the equity method as per
Ind AS 28 - Investments in Associates and
Joint Ventures.The Company accounts for
its share of post acquisition changes in
net assets of joint ventures, after
eliminating unrealised profits and losses
resulting from transactions between the
Company and its joint ventures to the
extent of its share, through its Consolidated
Statement of Profit and Loss, to the extent
such change is attributable to the
associates’ Statement of Profit and Loss
and through its reserves for the balance
based on available information. When the
Group’s share of losses of joint venture
exceeds the Group’s interest in that joint
venture (which includes any long term

interests that, in substance, form part of
the Group’s net investment joint venture),
the Group discontinues recognising its
share of further losses. Additional losses
are recognised only to the extent that the
Group has incurred legal or constructive
obligations or made payments on behalf
of the joint venture.

Fair Value Measurement
Group measures financial instruments at fair value
at each reporting date. Fair value is the price that
would be received to sell an asset or paid to
transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between
market participants at the measurement date. The
fair value measurement is based on the
presumption that the transaction to sell the asset
or transfer the liability takes place either:
•

in the principal market for the asset or
liability, or

•

in the absence of a principal market, in
the most advantageous market for the
asset or liability.

(b)

Financial assets measured at amortised
cost using effective interest rate method
less impairment if any. The EIR
amortisation is included in finance income
in the statement of profit and loss.

cost if both of the following conditions are met:

•

In addition, the Group may elect to designate
financial asset, which otherwise meets amortized
cost or FVTOCI criteria, as at FVTPL. If doing so
reduces or eliminates a measurement or
recognition inconsistency. The Group has not
designated any financial asset as at FVTPL.

Financial Assets

a)

The objective of the business model is
achieved both by collecting contractual
cash flows and selling the financial assets,
and

FVTPL is a residual category for financial Assets.
Any financial assets, which does not meet the
criteria for categorization as at amortized cost or
as FVTOCI, is classified as at FVTPL.

(B) Subsequent measurement
(i)

•

Debt instruments included within the FVTOCI
category are measured initially as well as at each
reporting date at fair value. Fair value movements
are recognized in the Other Comprehensive
Income (OCI). However, the company recognizes
interest income, impairment losses & reversals
and foreign exchange gain or loss in the P&L. On
de-recognition of the asset, cumulative gain or
loss previously recognised in OCI is reclassified
from the equity to P&L. Interest earned is
recognised using the EIR method.

Debt instrument at FVTOCI
A debt instrument is classified as at the FVTOCI
if both of the following criteria are met:

The principal or the most advantageous market
must be accessible to the company. The fair value
of an asset or a liability is measured using the
assumptions that market participants would use
when pricing the asset or liability, assuming that
market participants act in their economic best
interest. The company uses valuation techniques
that are appropriate in the circumstances and for
which sufficient data are available to measure fair
value, maximizing the use of relevant observable
inputs and minimizing the use of unobservable
inputs.

asset give rise on specified dates to cash
flows that are solely payments of principal
and interest on the principal amount

ECLs at each reporting date, right from its initial
recognitionGroup assesses on a forward looking basis
the expected credit losses associated with its assets
carried at amortised cost and FVTOCI debt instruments.
The impairment methodology applies on whether there
has been significant increase in credit risk.
2.23

Non-current assets (or disposal groups) are
classified as assets held for sale when their
carrying amount is to be recovered principally
through a sale transaction and a sale is
considered highly probable. The sale is
considered highly probable only when the asset
or disposal group is available for immediate sale
in its present condition, it is unlikely that the sale
will be withdrawn and sale is expected within one
year from the date of the classification. Disposal
groups classified as held for sale are stated at
the lower of carrying amount and fair value less
costs to sell. Property, plant and equipment and
intangible assets are not depreciated or amortised
once classified as held for sale. Assets classified
as held for sale are presented separately in the
statement of financial position.

Financial liabilities at amortised cost represented
by trade and other payables, security deposits
and retention money are initially recognized at
fair value, and subsequently carried at amortized
cost using the effective interest rate method.

Financial liabilities at FVTPL
The company has not designated in any financial
liabilities at FVTPL.

b.

Derecognition
Financial Asset

If the criteria stated by IND AS 105 “Non-current
Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued
Operations” are no longer met, the disposal group
ceases to be classified as held for sale. Noncurrent asset that ceases to be classified as held
for sale are measured at the lower of (i) its carrying
amount before the asset was classified as held
for sale, adjusted for depreciation that would have
been recognised had that asset not been
classified as held for sale, and (ii) its recoverable
amount at the date when the disposal group
ceases to be classified as held for sale.

A financial asset (or, where applicable, a part of a
financial asset or part of a group of similar financial
assets) is derecognized only when the
contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset
expires or it transfers the financial assets and
substantially all risks s and rewards of the
ownership of the asset.
Financial Liability
A financial liability is derecognised when the
obligation under the liability is discharged or
cancelled or expires. When an existing financial
liability is replaced by another from the same
lender on substantially different terms, or the terms
of an existing liability are substantially modified,
such an exchange or modification is treated as a
derecognition of the original liability and the
recognition of a new liability, and the difference in
the respective carrying amounts is recognised in
the income statement.

Cash and cash equivalent
Cash and cash equivalent comprise cash at bank
and on hand.It includes term deposits and short
term money market deposits with original
maturities of three months or less that are readily
convertible to known amounts of cash and which
are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in
value.

Sensitivity analysis:
The above sensitivity analysis is based on a change in an assumption while holding all other assumptions constant.
In practice, this is unlikely to occur, and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated. When calculating
the sensitivity of the defined benefit obligation to significant actuarial assumptions the same method (projected unit
credit method) has been applied as when calculating the defined benefit obligation recognised within the statement
of financial position.

(iii) Financial risk management
The Company’s principal financial liabilities comprise Borrowings from IRFC, trade payable and other payables. The
Company’s principal financial assets include trade and lease receivables and cash & cash equivalents that are
derived directly from its operations.The Company is exposed to market risk, credit risk and liquidity risk. The
company’s financial risk activities are governed by appropriate policies and procedures and that financial risk are
identified, measured and managed in accordance with the company’s policies and risk objectives. The board of
directors reviews the policies for managing each of these risk, which are summarised below:a) Market Risk
Market risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instruments will fluctuate because of
changes in market prices. Market risk comprises Interest rate risk and foreign currency risk. Financial instruments
affected by market risk includes loans and borrowing, deposits and other non derivative financial instruments.
i) Interest Rate Risk
Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instruments will fluctuate because of
change in market interest rate. The company has only loan from IRFC, the payment of interest and repayment of
principal of that is ensured by the Ministry of Railways; therefore the risk related to said loan is Nil, debt servicing
will pass through RVNL books only.
ii) Foreign Currency Risk
The company takes services from countries outside India for projects and is exposed to foreign currency risk
arising from such foreign currency transactions. Due to immateriality of foreign exchange amount company does
not hedge any risk.
b) Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Company if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to
meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from the Company’s receivables from customers. The company
is exposed to credit risk from its financial activities including deposits with banks, financial institutions and other
financial instruments. There is negligible risk for receivable from Ministry of railways also company does not have
any history of bad debts.
Financial instruments and cash deposits
Credit risk from balances with banks and financial institutions is managed in accordance with the company‘s
policy. Investment of surplus are made only with approved with counterparty on the basis of the financial quotes
received from the counterparty.
c) Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the company will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they become due. The
company manages its liquidity risk by ensuring, as far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to
meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or
risk to the company’s reputation.The company’s principal sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents and
the cash flow that is generated from operations. The company believes that the working capital is sufficient to meet
its current operational requirements. Any short term- surplus cash generated, over and above the amount required
for working capital management and other operational requirements, are retained as cash and investment in short

233

19oh a ANNUAL REPORT
2021-22

term deposits with banks. The said investments are made in instruments with appropriate maturities and sufficient
liquidity.

Note 32 Key sources of estimation uncertainty
The followings are the key assumptions concerning the future, and the key sources of estimation uncertainty at the
end of the reporting period that may have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amount
of assets and liabilities with next financial year.
a) Fair valuation measurement and valuation process
Financial instruments are measured initially at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost on the basis of
materiality, transaction value upto Rs. 12.00 lakhs are measured at fair value on initial recognition and subsequently
at amortised cost on group basis by considering that the amount is recoverable or payable at a average period of
5 years and Income and amortisation on such financial instruments has been considered on yearly basis. Transaction
value of 12.00 lakhs or more are measured at fair value at initial recognition and subsequently at amortised cost on
individual transaction basis. Impact of fair valuation of Staff loans and advances are immaterial therefore it has been
continuing at the carrying value.
The fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities is measured the valuation techniques including the DCF
model. The inputs to these method are taken from observable markets where possible, but where this is not
feasible, a degree of judgment is required in establishing fair values. Judgments include considerations of inputs
such as liquidity risk, credit risk and volatility. Changes in assumptions about these factors could affect the reported
fair value of financial instruments. See Note 31 for further disclosures.
b) Taxes
Deferred tax assets are recognized for unused tax losses and unabsorbed depreciation to the extent that it is
probable that taxable profit will be available against which losses can be utilised. Significant management judgment
is required to determine the amount of deferred tax asset that can be recognised, based upon the likely timing and
level of future taxable profit together with future tax planning strategies.
c ) Borrowings and Lease Receivables from Railway against Completed Projects
Company has borrowed funds from Indian Railway Finance Corporation for the purpose of construction of railway
projects. There is a moratorium period of 3 years for each year’s loan. During the said moratorium period, no
amount on account of interest and principal shall be payable. The interest shall be charged on yearly basis and
repayment of loan along with interest shall be once in a year (for a period of 12 years) after the completion of
moratorium period. Ministry of Railways would make available to RVNL the required funds thereafter, to enable them
to do the debt servicing. The debt servicing will pass through RVNL books. Accordingly, funds are received by RVNL
on each year from MoR and the same is transferred to IRFC immediately. Therefore, there is no impact on the
Statement of Profit and Loss.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT
TO THE MEMBERS OF RAIL VIKAS NIGAM LIMITED
Report on the Audit of the Consolidated IndAS Financial Statements
Qualified opinion
We have audited the accompanying consolidated IndAS financial statements of RAIL VIKAS NIGAM LIMITED,
(“the Parent”) and its subsidiary (the Parent and its subsidiary together referred to as ‘the Group’) and its joint
venture entities, which comprise the Consolidated Balance Sheet as at 31 st March 2022, the Consolidated Statement
of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity and
the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended and notes to the financial statements, including
a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information (hereinafter referred to as the
“Consolidated Financial Statements”).
In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, except for the effects
of the matter described in the “Basis for qualified opinion” section of our report, the aforesaid consolidated financial
statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”) in the manner so required and give
a true and fair view in conformity with the Indian Accounting Standards prescribed under section 133 of the Act read
with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended, (“Ind AS”) and other accounting
principles generally accepted in India, of the Consolidated state of affairs of the Group as at 31 st March , 2022 and
their consolidated profit(including consolidated other comprehensive loss), their consolidated changes in equity
and their consolidated cash flows for the year ended on that date.
Basis for qualified opinion
Goods & Service Tax (GST) accounts in the financial books of the Parent company are subject to reconciliation with
the GST portal. Pending reconciliation and in the absence of the requisite supporting documentation, we are unable
to comment on the resultant impact of the same on the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
We conducted our audit of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing
(SAS) specified under Section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described
in the “Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements “ section of our report. We are
independent of the Group in accordance with the Code ofEthics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of
India (“ICAI”) together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit ofthe consolidated financial statements
under the provisions of the Act and the Rules thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in
accordance with these requirements and the Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence obtained by us, is
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our qualified audit opinion.
Emphasis of matter
We draw your attention to the following matters:
a.

The Parent Company receives advance payment from Joint venture companies for incurring expenditures on
their projects. However, in case of one related party i.e. Krishnapatnam Railway Company Limited (KRCL),the
Parent Company is incurring project expenditures on a regular basis but insignificant amount has been
received from KRCL during the year and the total amount receivable from KRCL as on 3 1 st March, 2022 is
Rs.1368.28 crore which includes Rs.530.18 crore on account of interest(refer note nos. 10.1 & 10.6 to the
consolidated financial statements).

b.

Balances of some of the Trade Receivables, Other Assets, Trade and Other Payable accounts of the Parent
Company are subject to confirmation/reconciliation from the respective parties The Parent Company’s
management does not expect to have any material differences affecting the consolidated financial statements
for the year ended 31 st March, 2022 (refer note no. 49 to the consolidated financial statements).

Our opinion is not modified in respect of these matters.

Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the
consolidated financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of
the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a
separate opinion on these matters.
In addition to the matter described in the “Basis for qualified opinion” section, we have determined the matters
described below to be the key audit matters to be communicated in our report.
Key Audit Matter

Auditor’s Response

Provisions and Contingent liabilities relating to Our audit procedures included, but were not limited to
ongoing litigations
the following:
The Parent Company is subject to a number of legal,
regulatory, arbitration and tax cases for which final
outcome cannot be easily predicted and which could
potentially result in significant liabilities.
Management’s disclosures with regards toprovisions and
contingent liabilities relating to provisions and contingent
liabilities relating to ongoing litigations are presented in
note 37 to the Company’s consolidated financial
statements.
The assessment of whether a liability is recognised as
a provision or disclosed as a contingent liability in the
consolidated financial statements is inherently subjective
and requires significant managementjud ement in
determination of the cash outflows from the business,
interpretation of applicable laws and regulations, and
careful examination of pending assessments at various
levels of regulatory authorities.
Since the amounts involved are significant and due to
the range of possible outcomesleading to high estimation
uncertainty that requires significant management and
auditor judgement, this matter is considered to be a
key audit matter for the current year audit.

identification and measurement of provisions and
contingent liabilities relating to ongoing litigation
implemented by the Management, through various
discussions held with Parent Company’s legal and
finance personnel.

to assess appropriateness of such conclusions,
involving experts as required.

z

Our opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express

In connection with our audit of the consolidated financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information

inconsistent with the consolidated financial statements or our knowledge obtained during the course of audit or
otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information,
we are required to communicate the fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.
Responsibilities of the management and those charged with governance for the consolidated financial
statements

consolidated statement of changes in equity and consolidated statement of cash flows of the Group including its
joint venture entities in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in India, including the Ind AS
specified under section 133 of the Act, read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015. The
respective Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group and its joint venture entities are responsible
for maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding of the
assets of the Group and its joint venture entities for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection
and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and
prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating
effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and
presentation of the financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement,
whether due to fraud or error, which have been used for the purpose of preparation of the consolidated financial
statements by the Directors of the Parent Company, as aforesaid.
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the respective Board of Directors of the companies included in
the Group and its joint venture entities are responsible for assessing the ability of the Group and its joint venture
entities, to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the
going concern basis of accounting, unless the respective Board of Directors either intends to liquidate the Group or
to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
The respective Board of Directors of the companies included in the Group and its joint venture entities, are responsible
for overseeing the financial reporting process of the companies included in the Group and its joint venture entities.
Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a whole
are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our
opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in
accordance with SAS will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from
fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to
influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with Standards on Auditing specified under section 143(10) of the Act, we exercise
professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:
z

Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether
due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit
evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a
material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve
collusion, omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.

z

Obtain an understanding of internal financial control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures
that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under Section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for
expressing our opinion on whether the Group and its joint venture entities have adequate internal financial
controls system in place and the operating effectiveness of such controls.

z

Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness ofaccounting estimates
and related disclosures made by management.

z

Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based
on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that
may cast significant doubt on the ability of the Group and its joint venture entities to continue as a going
concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s
report to the related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate,
to modify our opinion, Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our
auditor)s report, However, future events or conditions may cause the Group and its joint venture entities to
cease to continue as a going concern.

z

Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, including
the disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions
and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.

z

Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities within the
Group, and joint venture entities to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are
262

responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audit of the financial statements of such
entities included in the consolidated financial statements of which we are the independent auditors. The
other entities included in the consolidated financial statements have not been audited. We remain solely
responsible for our audit opinion.
We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and
timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we
identify during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical
requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may
reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of
most significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the
key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public
disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be
communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to
outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.
Other matters
The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of one subsidiary which has not been
audited by their auditor, whose financial statements reflected total assets of Rs. 47.56 crore as at 31 st March, 2022,
total revenue ofRs. 15.85 crore, total net profit after tax of Rs. 1.93 crore, and total comprehensive income of Rs.

Annexure-'A' To the Independent Auditor’s Report
Referred to in paragraph 2(f) under ‘Report on other legal and regulatory requirements’ section of our
report of even date for the year ended 31 st March, 2022 to the members of Rail Vikas Nigam Limited.
Report on the Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting under Clause (i) of Sub-section 3 of
Section 143 of the Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”)
In conjunction with our audit of the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended 31 st March, 2022,
we have audited the internal financial controls over financial reporting of Rail Vikas Nigam Limited (“the Parent
company”) and its subsidiary (the Parent company and is subsidiary together referred to as “the Group”)and its joint
venture entities as of that date.
Management’s responsibility for internal financial controls
The respective Boards of Directors of the Parent company, its subsidiary company and joint venture entities are
responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial controls based on the internal control over financial
reporting criteria established by the respective companies/entities considering the essential components of internal
control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting issued by the
Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (‘the ICAI’). These responsibilities include the design, implementation
and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the orderly and
efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to the respective company’s policies, the safeguarding of its
assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting
records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required under the Act.
Auditors’ responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the internal financial controls over financial reporting of the Parent
company, its subsidiary company and joint venture entities based on our audit, We conducted our audit in accordance
with the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls over Financial Reporting (the “Guidance Note”) and
the Standards on Auditing, issued by ICAI and deemed to be prescribed under section 143 (10) ofthe Companies
Act, 2013, to the extent applicable to an audit of internal financial controls, both applicable to an audit of Internal
Financial Controls and, both issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. Those Standards and the
Guidance Note require that we comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether adequate internal financial controls over financial reporting was established and maintained
and if such controls operated effectively in all material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial
controls system over financial reporting and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls over
financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls over financial reporting, assessing
the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of
internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including
the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained and the audit evidence obtained by the other auditors in terms
of their report referred to in the Other matters paragraph below, is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our
audit opinion on the internal financial controls system over financial reporting of the Parent company, its subsidiary
company and joint venture entities.
Meaning of internal financial controls over financial reporting
A company’s internal financial control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal financial control over financial
reporting includes those policies and procedures that
(1)

pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions
and dispositions of the assets of the company;

(2)

provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures
of the company are being made only in accordance with authorisations of management and directors of the
265

okf"kZd fjiksVZ

19oh a ANNUAL REPORT
2021-22

company; and
(3)

provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or
disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.

Inherent limitations of internal financial controls over financial reporting
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls over financial reporting, including the possibility of
collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and
not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls over financial reporting to future
periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial control over financial reporting may become inadequate
because of Changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Other matters
We did not audit the internal financial controls with reference to financial statements in so far as it relates to one
subsidiary company and in respect of six joint venture entities, whose internal financials controls with reference to
financial statements have not been audited by us. The internal financial controls with reference to consolidated
financial statements in so far as it relates to such subsidiary company and joint venture entities have not been
audited by the other auditors till the date of our audit report.
Our opinion is not modified in respect of this matter.
Opinion
In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to *the explanation given to us, the Parent Company
has, in all material respects, an adequate internal financial controls system over financial reporting (except for the
matter specified in the “Basis for qualified opinion” section of our report) and such internal financial controls over
financial reporting were operating effectively as at 31 st March, 2022, based on the internal control over financial
reporting criteria established by the Parent company considering the essential components of internal control
stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute
of Chartered Accountants of India.

Emphasis of Matter
The parent Company receives advance
payment from Joint Venture Companies for
incurringexpenditures on their projects.
However, in case of one related party i.e.
Krishnapatnam Railway Company Limited
(KRCL), Parent Company is incurring project
expenditures on aregular basis but
insignificant amount has been received from
KRCL during the year and thetotal amount
receivable from KRCL as on 31st March,
2022 is Rs.1368.28 crore whichincludes
Rs.530.18 crore on account of interest (refer
note nos. 10.1 & 10.6 to the consolidated
financial statements).

Management Reply
M/s Krishnapatnam Railways Company Limited (KPRCL)
is a Special Purpose Vehicle created especially for
providing rail connectivity to Krishnapatnam Port in Andhra
Pradesh. As on 31st March 2022 Rail Vikas Nigam
Limitedholds 49.76% equity sharesin KPRCL. The work
was executed in two phases. The execution of the
construction work was undertaken by RVNL. As per the
construction agreement, KPRCL was to payquarterly
advances to RVNL for execution of the work. but due to
dispute between MoR and KPRCL regarding apportionment
of revenue from traffic, KPRCL havenot able to generate
enough revenue to finance the construction work through
RVNL. But as the contracts had already been awarded by
RVNL, commitments had to be met out of its own source.
Also, as per the terms and conditions of the concession
agreement stopping of works would have resulted into
bigger loss to RVNL.
Since the second phase of the project has also been
opened for traffic which is now picking up after thedecline
due to the impact of COVID -19, it is expected that
sufficient revenue will be generated and KPRCL will be
paying back the balance due to RVNL along with interest
as per the construction agreement. During the current
financial year i.e. 2021-22 already by 31.07.22 Rs. 14
crores have been received from KPRCL.
Authorities of KPRCL are being pursued for arranging
payments to RVNL.

2.

Balances of some of the Trade Receivables,
Other Assets, Trade and Other Payable
accounts of the Parent Company are subject
to confirmation/reconciliation from the
respective parties .Parent company’s0
management does not expect to have any
material differences affecting the financial
statements for the year ended 31stMarch,
2022 (refer note no. 49 to the consolidated
financial statements).

These are mainly advances to Zonal Railways given either
for execution of works on behalf of RVNL or supply of
sleepers and rails for utilisation in RVNL projects, which
is a regular process. Zonal Railways are advised to give
accountal of the advance given but confirmations of
outstanding balances from some Zonal Railways were not
received in spite of repeated requests. The advance was
given to Electricity Companies for either power supplies or
for shifting of cables in connection with the projects against
which the accountalis received on completion of the work.
Payables mainly include funds received from MoR pending
adjustment and security deposits/retention monies.
Management does not expect to have any material financial
impact of such pending confirmations/reconciliations.

opportunities” for HSRCISL in this field.
After Successful commissioning of projects for
Kolkata Metro, HSRCISL has gained expertise
and capability for Metro projects, which will be
helpful in capturing new opportunities.

Threats

The dependency for experienced of technical
manpower over RVNL and other Railway

which sufficient data are available to measure fair
value, maximizing the use of relevant observable
inputs and minimizing the use of unobservable
inputs.

d.

f.

Company applies expected credit loss (ECL)
model for measurement and recognition of
impairment loss. The Company follows’ simplified
approach’ for recognition of impairment loss

or eliminates a measurement or recognition
inconsistency. The company has not designated
any financial asset as at FVTPL.Financial assets
included within the FVTPL category are measured
at fair value with all changes recognized in the
P&L.

Company assesses on a forward looking basis
the expected credit losses associated with its
assets carried at amortised cost and FVTOCI debt
instruments. The impairment methodology
applies on whether there has been significant
increase in credit risk.

obligation under the liability is discharged or
cancelled or expires. When an existing financial
liability is replaced by another from the same

derecognition of the original liability and the
recognition of a new liability and the difference in
the respective carrying amounts is recognised in
the income statement.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT
TO THE MEMBERS OF HSRC INFRA SERVICES LIMITED (Formerly known as “HIGH SPEED RAIL
CORPORATION OF INDIA LIMITED”
Opinion
We have audited the accompanying financial statements of HSRC Infra Services Limited (“the Company”), which
comprise the Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2022, the Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive
Income), the Statement of Changes in Equity and the Statement of Cash Flows for the year ended on that date, and
a summary of the significant accounting policies and other explanatory information (hereinafter referred to as “the
financial statements”).
In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid
financial statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”) in the manner so required
and give a true and fair view in conformity with the Indian Accounting Standards prescribed under section 133 of the
Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended, (“Ind AS”) and other accounting
principles generally accepted in India, of the state of affairs of the Company as at March 31, 2022, the profit and
total comprehensive profit, changes in equity and its cash flows for the year ended on that date.
Basis Opinion
We conducted our audit of the financial statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing specified under
section 143(10) of the Act (SAs). Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditor’s
Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company
in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) together with
the independence requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements under the provisions of the
Act and the Rules made thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these
requirements and the ICAI’s Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and
appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion on the financial statements.
Information Other than the Financial Statements and Auditor’s Report Thereon
The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation of the other information. The other information
comprises the information included in the Management Discussion and Analysis, Board’s Report including Annexures
to Board’s Report, Business Responsibility Report, Corporate Governance and Shareholder’s Information, but does
not include the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon. The above report is expected to be made
available to us after the date of this auditor’s report.
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of
assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information identified
above when it becomes available and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent
with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information,
we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.
Management’s Responsibilities for the Financial Statements
The Company’s Board of Directors is responsible for the matters stated in section 134(5) of the Act with respect to
the preparation of these financial statements that give a true and fair view of the financial position, financial performance,
total comprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows of the Company in accordance with the Ind AS and
other accounting principles generally accepted in India. This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate
accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding the assets of the Company and for
preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies;
making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance of
adequate internal financial controls, that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of
the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the financial statements that give a true and
fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.

322

In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue
as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis
of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no
realistic alternative but to do so.
The Board of Directors are responsible for overseeing the Company’s financial reporting process.
Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from
material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion.
Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance
with SAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error
and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the
economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with SAs, we exercise professional judgment and maintain professional scepticism
throughout the audit. We also:
z

Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or
error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement
resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional
omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.

z

Obtain an understanding of internal financial controls relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures
that are appropriate in the circumstances. Under section 143(3)(i) of the Act, we are also responsible for
expressing our opinion on whether the Company has adequate internal financial controls system in place
and the operating effectiveness of such controls.

z

Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates
and related disclosures made by management.

z

Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based
on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that
may cast significant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a
material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures
in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are
based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions
may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.

z

Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures,
and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that
achieves fair presentation.

Materiality is the magnitude of misstatements in the financial statements that, individually or in aggregate, makes
it probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable user of the financial statements may be
influenced. We consider quantitative materiality and qualitative factors in (i) planning the scope of our audit work
and in evaluating the results of our work; and (ii) to evaluate the effect of any identified misstatements in the financial
statements.
We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and
timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we
identify during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical
requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may
reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

ANNEXURE “A”
TO THE INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT
(Referred to in paragraph 1(f) under ‘Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements’ section of our report to
the Members of HSRC INFRA SERVICES LIMITED (Formerly known as “HIGH SPEED RAIL
CORPORATION OF INDIA LIMITED of even date)
Report on the Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting under Clause (i) of Sub-section 3 of
Section 143 of the Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”)
We have audited the internal financial controls over financial reporting of HSRC Infra Services Limited (Formerly
Known as “High Speed Rail Corporation of India Limited (“the Company”) as of March 31, 2022 in conjunction
with our audit of the financial statements of the Company for the year ended on that date.
Management’s Responsibility for Internal Financial Controls
The Board of Directors of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining internal financial controls
based on the internal control over financial reporting criteria established by the Company considering the essential
components of internal control stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial
Reporting issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India. These responsibilities include the design,
implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring
the orderly and efficient conduct of its business, including adherence to respective company’s policies, the safeguarding
of its assets, the prevention and detection of frauds and errors, the accuracy and completeness of the accounting
records, and the timely preparation of reliable financial information, as required under the Companies Act, 2013.
Auditor’s Responsibility
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the internal financial controls over financial reporting of the Company
based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial
Controls Over Financial Reporting (the “Guidance Note”) issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India
and the Standards on Auditing prescribed under Section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013, to the extent applicable
to an audit of internal financial controls. Those Standards and the Guidance Note require that we comply with
ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether adequate
internal financial controls over financial reporting was established and maintained and if such controls operated
effectively in all material respects.
Our audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the adequacy of the internal financial
controls system over financial reporting and their operating effectiveness. Our audit of internal financial controls over
financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal financial controls over financial reporting, assessing
the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of
internal control based on the assessed risk. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, including
the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained, is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit
opinion on the internal financial controls system over financial reporting of the Company.
Meaning of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal financial control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal financial control over financial
reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable
detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorisations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide
reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised acquisition, use, or disposition of
the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Limitations of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting
Because of the inherent limitations of internal financial controls over financial reporting, including the possibility of
collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and

326

not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the internal financial controls over financial reporting to future
periods are subject to the risk that the internal financial control over financial reporting may become inadequate
because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
Opinion
In our opinion, to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the Company has, in all
material respects, an adequate internal financial controls system over financial reporting and such internal financial
controls over financial reporting were operating effectively as at March 31, 2022, based on the internal control over
financial reporting criteria established by the Company considering the essential components of internal control
stated in the Guidance Note on Audit of Internal Financial Controls Over Financial Reporting issued by the Institute
of Chartered Accountants of India.
